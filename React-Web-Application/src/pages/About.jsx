        <h1>Welcome to the World of Pokémon!</h1>
        <p>Pokémon are creatures of various types and abilities that inhabit the world alongside humans. Each Pokémon species has its own unique characteristics, including its type, which determines its strengths and weaknesses in battles.</p>
        <p>There are currently 18 different Pokémon types, each with its own strengths and weaknesses against other types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Normal</li>
          <li>Fighting</li>
          <li>Flying</li>
          <li>Poison</li>
          <li>Ground</li>
          <li>Rock</li>
          <li>Bug</li>
          <li>Ghost</li>
          <li>Steel</li>
          <li>Fire</li>
          <li>Water</li>
          <li>Grass</li>
          <li>Electric</li>
          <li>Psychic</li>
          <li>Ice</li>
          <li>Dragon</li>
          <li>Dark</li>
          <li>Fairy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each Pokémon can have one or two types, which influence their moves and abilities. For example, a Water-type Pokémon will be strong against Fire-type Pokémon but weak against Grass-type Pokémon.</p>
        <p>Trainers in the Pokémon world strive to become Pokémon Masters by collecting and training a diverse team of Pokémon, each with its own unique type and abilities. Battles between trainers often involve strategic matchups based on Pokémon types to gain an advantage in battle.</p>
