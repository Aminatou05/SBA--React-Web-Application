      <h1>Welcome to the World of Pokémon!</h1>
      <p>
        Pokémon are creatures of various types and abilities that inhabit the
        world alongside humans. Each Pokémon species has its own unique
        characteristics, including its type, which determines its strengths and
        weaknesses in battles.
      </p>
      Each Pokémon can have one or two types, which influence their moves and
      abilities. For example, a Water-type Pokémon will be strong against
      Fire-type Pokémon but weak against Grass-type Pokémon.
      <p>
        Trainers in the Pokémon world strive to become Pokémon Masters by
        collecting and training a diverse team of Pokémon, each with its own
        unique type and abilities. Battles between trainers often involve
        strategic matchups based on Pokémon types to gain an advantage in
        battle.

        There are currently 18 different Pokémon types, each with its own
        strengths and weaknesses against other types:

      <p>The World of Pokémon In the vast and vibrant world of Pokémon, adventure
      beckons to those who seek to become Pokémon Masters. From the lush
      grasslands of Kanto to the sun-kissed shores of Alola, every region brims
      with a plethora of creatures, each with its own unique abilities and
      mysteries. ## The Journey Begins A young trainer's journey begins with a
      choice: **Bulbasaur**, **Charmander**, or **Squirtle**? This decision
      marks the first step on a path filled with challenges and battles. With
      Poké Balls in hand, trainers venture into the wild, where **Pidgeys**
      flutter and **Rattatas** scurry. ## The Quest for Gym Badges As trainers
      travel from town to town, they face Gym Leaders, skilled opponents who
      test their mettle. Each victory earns them a badge, a symbol of their
      growing bond with their Pokémon and their prowess in battle. ## Legendary
      Encounters Legends speak of rare and powerful Pokémon that only the most
      dedicated trainers can encounter. The elusive **Mewtwo** hides in the
      depths of a cave, while the majestic **Lugia** soars across the ocean's
      expanse. ## Pokémon Contests and Battles Beyond battles, trainers can
      showcase their Pokémon's style and grace in contests, where moves like
      **Solar Beam** and **Ice Beam** dazzle the audience. In the heat of the
      Pokémon League, strategies are tested, and champions are made. ## The Bond
      of Friendship At the heart of every trainer's journey is the bond they
      share with their Pokémon. It's a friendship that transcends battles, one
      that grows with every shared victory and comforted defeat. The world of
      Pokémon is a place where dreams are pursued, friendships are forged, and
      legends come to life. It's a world waiting to be explored, one Pokémon at
      a time.</p>
